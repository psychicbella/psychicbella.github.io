										<h2>Personal Stories </h2>

										<p>Here are some personal stories from people who have actually meet and paid 
										Bella for her services. They will give some details on the content of their inquiry, 
										the amount they paid and the services rendered or promised but not rendered, and how was the 
										communication like in the process. If you have your own story, tell us and we will add them here.</p>
										
										<h3>The case for Y</h3>
										<p>
											My story is I recently got out of a divorce and have some unresolved 
											feeling that I was hoping to clear through a psychic after seeing many 
											psychologist. It probably seem like a silly attempt of mine. After getting 
											first reading from Bella which cost $45, I felt quite comfortable with her. 
											I also reveal to her that there are some problems concerning a family member 
											of mine that we weren't able to resolve for 20 years. Bella charged another $250.00 to 
											answer my questions about the family member and convinced me that for 
											additional $2,500.00 she will be able to cleanse my Karma and read deeper into 
											the problem and she will be able to find a solution to the problem. She asked 
											that i deposit $2,500 to her Wells Fargo account, which i did on Monday 
											December 30th, 2013. Ever since then, when I try to contact her, she was 
											never available. Her daughter Gina Lee end up responding to my text stating 
											that she's busy and will get back to me. I was able to get hold of her and she 
											told me she will get back to me 6PM today. Now, her phone goes directly to her 
											voicemail. I looked online and found out that she has been reported many times 
											on many websites. I figure I probably got scammed as well. </p>

									<h3>The case for B</h3>
										<p>
											Bella, is nothing but a scam artist. She writes her own reviews. 
											I have contacted the Better Business Bureau in Florida. She reads my 
											friends including myself and she tells us the same thing that we were all 
											business owners in our past life and that the spirit is on us and we have 
											to pay her $100.00 for every year we were born to remove the bad spirit. 
											She took my credit card number and and charge my credit card in the amount 
											of $12,000 which she had to pay back to the Credit Card company.
